# Creating an Accessible Autocomplete Component from Scratch

We've all used autocomplete components â€“ those handy search boxes that suggest options as you type. They're everywhere from Google search to your favorite e-commerce site. But have you ever tried using one with just your keyboard? Or with a screen reader? For many users with disabilities, these components can be frustratingly difficult to use.

In this post, I'll walk through building an autocomplete component that's not just functional, but fully accessible to everyone.

## Try It Out

Before we dive in, give this autocomplete component a spin:

<Autocomplete />

Try typing a programming language name (like "Java" or "Python") and notice how you can:

- Navigate through suggestions with your keyboard (up/down arrows)
- Select an option with Enter
- Dismiss the dropdown with Escape
- Or just click with your mouse if that's your thing

This kind of seamless experience should be available to all users, regardless of how they navigate the web.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility often gets pushed to the bottom of the priority list, but accessible components create a better experience for everyone:

- Keyboard navigation helps power users work more efficiently
- Clear visual states help users with cognitive disabilities, but also help anyone who's distracted or tired
- Proper labeling helps screen reader users, but also improves SEO

Web accessibility is also a legal requirement in many countries.

## The Accessibility Checklist

For an autocomplete component to be truly accessible, it needs to:

1. Be fully keyboard navigable
2. Announce changes to screen readers
3. Have proper visual focus indicators
4. Follow established design patterns
5. Provide clear feedback for all states

Let's see how we can implement these requirements without getting lost in complexity.

## The Core Component Structure

The autocomplete component requires three main elements:

1. An input field for typing
2. A dropdown list of suggestions
3. State management to track what's happening

Here's a simplified version of our component structure:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="jsx" style={a11yDark}>
  {`function Autocomplete({ items }) {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
  const [filteredItems, setFilteredItems] = useState([]);
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(-1);
  
  // Filter items based on input
  // Handle keyboard navigation
  // Render input and dropdown
}`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

The component handles user interactions and communicates with assistive technologies through ARIA attributes.

## Making It Keyboard Accessible

Keyboard accessibility is the foundation of an accessible component. Users should be able to do everything without touching a mouse.

Here's how we handle keyboard navigation:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="jsx" style={a11yDark}>
{`const handleKeyDown = (e) => {
  if (!isOpen) return;

switch (e.key) {
case 'ArrowDown':
e.preventDefault();
setSelectedIndex(prev =>
prev < filteredItems.length - 1 ? prev + 1 : prev
);
break;
case 'ArrowUp':
e.preventDefault();
setSelectedIndex(prev => (prev > 0 ? prev - 1 : 0));
break;
case 'Enter':
if (selectedIndex >= 0) {
e.preventDefault();
setInputValue(filteredItems[selectedIndex]);
setIsOpen(false);
}
break;
case 'Escape':
e.preventDefault();
setIsOpen(false);
break;
}
};`}

</SyntaxHighlighter>

We prevent the default behavior for arrow keys (which would move the cursor in the input) and handle navigation ourselves. This gives users precise control over the suggestion list.

## Speaking to Screen Readers with ARIA

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes enable communication with screen readers. These attributes provide information to assistive technologies about the UI state and structure.

Here are the key ARIA attributes we need:

```jsx
<input
  aria-autocomplete="list"
  aria-controls="listbox-id"
  aria-expanded={isOpen}
  aria-activedescendant={selectedIndex >= 0 ? `option-${selectedIndex}` : undefined}
/>

<ul
  id="listbox-id"
  role="listbox"
>
  {filteredItems.map((item, index) => (
    <li
      id={`option-${index}`}
      role="option"
      aria-selected={selectedIndex === index}
    >
      {item}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

These attributes tell screen readers:

- This is an autocomplete with a list of suggestions
- Whether the dropdown is currently open
- Which option is currently selected
- The relationship between the input and the dropdown

## Visual Feedback Is Crucial

Accessibility isn't just about screen readers. Visual feedback helps users with cognitive disabilities, motor impairments, and anyone using your component.

Key visual considerations:

- Clear focus styles (never remove the focus outline without replacing it)
- Distinct hover and selection states
- Sufficient color contrast
- Visible text at various zoom levels

Here's the CSS for focus and selection states:

```css
.autocomplete-option:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid #4299e1;
  outline-offset: -2px;
}

.autocomplete-option.selected {
  background-color: #ebf8ff;
  font-weight: 500;
}
```

## Testing Is Essential

Testing ensures your accessible component works for all users. Test the following:

1. Using your component with only the keyboard
2. Turning on a screen reader and navigating through it
3. Zooming in to 200% to ensure everything is still usable
4. Checking color contrast with a tool like the axe DevTools

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

When building accessible components, here are some common mistakes to watch out for:

1. **Keyboard traps**: Make sure users can tab away from your component
2. **Missing focus states**: Always provide visible focus indicators
3. **Timeout issues**: Some users need more time to interact with UI elements
4. **Relying on color alone**: Always use multiple indicators (color + text/shape)
5. **Forgetting about touch devices**: Ensure your component works on mobile too

## Wrapping Up

Building accessible components creates a better experience for all users. By implementing proper accessibility features in your autocomplete component, you ensure it works for everyone, regardless of how they interact with the web.

Accessibility should be considered from the start of your projects, not as an afterthought.
