## Understanding the Challenge

CSS animations breathe life into our web pages, allowing us to animate elements and create engaging user experiences. One critical aspect of CSS animations is the iteration count, which determines how many times an animation should repeat.

In theory, setting the iteration count property should be a piece of cake. But in reality, it often feels like a wild goose chase. Animations may refuse to repeat as intended or stop abruptly, leaving us scratching our heads in confusion.

## Unveiling the Mysteries

To gain a deeper understanding of the challenges surrounding animation iteration count, I turned to trusted resources like W3Schools and the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). These platforms provide invaluable documentation and insights into CSS properties and their behaviors.

On the W3Schools CSS reference page, I found information specifically addressing the CSS3 animation iteration count property[^1]. This gave me a grasp of the syntax and possible values that can be assigned to this property. However, W3Schools alone couldn't unlock the secrets of the animation iteration count's unpredictable nature.

MDN, a go-to resource for web developers, offered detailed documentation on the animation-delay property[^2]. Although animation delay and iteration count are separate properties, understanding their relationship shed some light on the challenges we face when working with CSS animations.
